# ML_Models
Various Machine Learning Models


# model 1: 
- Basic Model, learning the basics of machine learning

# model 2: 
- tries to use all types of multi-classification        algorithms, which then takes the average of them and then provides an accuracy
- It uses a dataset for the number of vowels used by average 
- I found this dataset on stanfords data set website https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/data.html
- The vowel_test.py file is just for testing the data set, and see if it works 
- The main file is machine_learning_model_2.py
- Run that file by 'python3 machine_learning_model_2.py '

# model 3:
- Tries to create a prediction if a certain thing is a glass, by using data of its opacity, and other characteristics 
- can be run using 'python3 machine_learning_model_3.py'
- 'glass.csv' contains the data, to make it better we need to sort it in a better way

# model 4: 
- This is a dataset that tries to differentiate between maligning and benign cancer data set
- this would be one of the best type of machine learning model we could use to differentiate between particles, and other datasets
- like radiation and something else to get an anomaly
- Run using ' python3 machine_learning_model_4.py'
- it also puts out the predictions in a text file 'predictions.txt'
